### WORK EXPERIENCE

I have started learning html and css about fifteen years ago but did not finish. Two years ago I started learning at
HTML Academy. At Academy I learned all interactive courses. Then I decided to learn JavaScript and become front-end web
developer. I have no work experience in IT but I would like to become good specialist. I work in the power industry now
and combine work and study. I want to work in front-end or back-end development in future.
